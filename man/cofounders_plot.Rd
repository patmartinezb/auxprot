\description{
\code{cofounders_plot()} uses the information provided by calculating
a PCA, extracts the top principal components (PCs), which are orthogonal
variables explaining the information contained within it. Then, the
different clinical or technical variables indicated in the metadata are
regressed against the PCs. The heatmap shows the values of the RÂ² and
significance (FDR), indicating the strength of the relationship between the
variables and the PCs.
